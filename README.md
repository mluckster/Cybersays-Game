### Cyberpunk Themed Simon Game - [play](https://mluckster.github.io/Cybersays-Game/)

This is a recreation of the game Simon - with a cyberpunk aesthetic. Sit back, relax, and get memorizing. Click the circles in the order they light up! 

#### Features
- Eight Intense Levels
- Two Difficulty Modifiers
    - Pick up the speed with the fast modifier
    - Change the pattern every round by enabling the Xtrme modifier

#### Background

The inspiration for this game came from the game "Simon" and the human benchmark website's small test for visual memory. My goal was to put a slight twist on the orientation of the game board and add a more stylish look, so I decided to make an asymmetrical grid, and incorporate a cyberpunk aesthetic.
