#### Background

The insipriation for this kind of game came from the human benchmark website. The small games were always fun to play every so often to see how well you would do. I decided to go with a game similar to the 'visual memory' test on the site. I wanted to have a slight twist on the orientation of the game board and a more stylish look to the game, which was how the asymmetrical game grid came from. The style and look I wanted was something between Hotline Miami and Cyberpunk 2077.
